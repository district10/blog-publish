<h1 id="dvorak-v.s.-qwerty">Dvorak v.s. Qwerty</h1>
<ul>
<li>Less Finger Movement
<ul>
<li>Dvorak used 1/3 the finger movement of Qwerty.</li>
<li>Dvorak had 20% less of the minimum movement required to type this one question than did Qwerty.</li>
<li>The chart below shows that Dvorak used about 61% ( 26661 mm) of the movement to type this letter than Qwerty, at 100% ( 43904 mm ). This translates to Dvorak at 26661 mm, or 87.54 feet, and Qwerty, at 43904 mm, or 144.15 feet.for a difference of 56.61 feet, less used when using Dvorak. This figure is when using the &#8216;less experienced&#8217; pattern of motion described above, a more efficient, experienced typist might reduce this somewhat, but even as a hypothetical example, half of this would be 28 or so feet, still quite a bit to walk one&#8217;s fingers, when there is an easier way.</li>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://lifehacker.com/should-i-use-an-alternative-keyboard-layout-like-dvorak-1447772004">I&#8217;ve been using the Dvorak layout since about 1993. I taught myself over about a month&#8212;just forced myself to use it. Today, I can switch between QWERTY and Dvorak if I need to (though QWERTY&#8217;s harder for me now) and I LOVE Dvorak.</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://lifehacker.com/should-i-use-an-alternative-keyboard-layout-like-dvorak-1447772004">Your story sounds a lot like mine. During that transitional period, when I was still terrible at Dvorak, I&#8217;d occasionally switch back to Qwerty when I needed to type quickly (say, when chatting with someone). The thing that really made me stick with Dvorak was the clear difference in how my wrists felt: when I was typing with Dvorak, I didn&#8217;t notice them at all, but when I switched back to Qwerty I could almost immediately feel the stress in them. 14 years later, I&#8217;m still glad I made the switch.</a></p></li>
