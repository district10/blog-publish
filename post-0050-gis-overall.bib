@article{AllemanNathanF.Holly2011,
abstract = {Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping has emerged as a popular method to convey complex social, demographic, and geographic data in such fields as education, law, and the social and physical sciences. However, researchers, practitioners, and policymakers may not be aware of or sensitive to the complex issues of power, exclusion, meaning-making, and agenda-setting embedded in an apparently self-evident visual representation format. Nor are they likely to be aware of the ongoing debate between cartographers and GIS technicians over the responsibility of map makers to anticipate and address social and ethical issues related to data representation. This paper is based on the authors? process of encountering, employing, and reflecting upon GIS mapping during a state-wide project examining the distribution, activities, and target populations of college access provider organizations. Categories of logistical, representational, and interpretational issues arose, requiring the researchers to consider how their mapping efforts might be used in an educational policy arena to misrepresent, oversimplify, or exclude some constituents from policy formation and resource allocation processes. In turn, educational researchers considering GIS mapping are challenged to do so fully aware of the methodological and epistemological challenges of the process.[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
