protection of the green house, but died out quickly under rain and
lighting.

That&#39;s exactly what our life looks like, we young people look strong as to
fear nothing, but can&#39;t survive terrible conditions alone.  As the new
generation, we receive intensive care and protection from our family,
school and the society. We gain fair amount of knowledge, cultivate good
manners and act like we are capable of living independently.  However, we
are so far away from that, that a small challenge may make us fall and
fail. In other words, we are spoilt.

Real life makes real man. Man can&#39;t gain strength in a cozy life and we
must devote ourselves in challenges, drawbacks and hardships, then we grow.
Take the pain to achieve the gains.</code></pre>

<p>Write an essay of 160-200 words based on the following drawing. In your essay, you should first describe the drawing, then interpret its meaning, and give your comment on it.</p>
<pre class="tzx-bigquote"><code>As is illustrated on the drawing, the old father has three sons and one
daughter, but none of them seems willing to take care of him.  Instead,
they endavour to keep off their father just like a goal keeper does to the
ball, which corners the old man into a terrible, lonely and helpless
situation.

The drawing reveals the pathetic reality of some old people, they tender
and raise their children and make them grow but end up to be abandoned by
their own children. We should help them.  First, government should build a
system of policy to regulate this kind of misfortune. Actually, there are
already some and one of them is really effective though controversal which
says it is illeagle not to go back home visiting the old ones in a constant
2 years.  Moreover, school education should pay more attention towards this
issue to guide people even the whole society to love, respect and take care
of the old.  Still, volunteers should be called up to help.  For example,
young puiples may volunteer to talk and play with the old ones which not
only helps to releave lonliness of the later but still is educational to
the former. Last but not the least, welfare, key to this problem, should be
set up.

As is discussed above, the old people need our help and we shall take our
undeniable responsibility. After all, everyone will be old and doesn&#39;t want
to be left alone and helpless by the society.</code></pre>

<pre class="tzx-bigquote"><code>Dear Maomao,

Yesterday, I reviewed again *Big Fish*, one of my beloved best movies.  It
tells a fantasy story about a father, a hard one to undertand.  The
father&#39;s story seems irrealistic and not logical at once but turns out
genuine in the end.

It&#39;s a touching love story about Edward Bloon (the father) and Sandraw
Templeton, a faithful dreamful one which is not common nowadays.  It&#39;s an
advanture with lots of fantacy everyone would enjoy.  It&#39;s a porcess to
undertsand how a father is and his lifestyle.

Anyway, *Big Fish* is one of my favorite movies and I highly recommend you
it.  I can&#39;t tell you more without being a spoiler thought I really want
to. Enjoy!

<pre class="tzx-bigquote"><code>As is shown on the drawing, travellers on vacation throw away garbage
delibritely to the river, which makes the beautiful senery ugly and
disgusting as you can see.

This exactly reveals the concerning reality, that visitors bring tourist
sites wealth and fortune but also along with environmental problems which
in fact cost a lot. These grabage may contaminate the environment and cause
a higher admistration fee to the local goverment which for sure will lead
to a coresponding higher touring expense to visitors.  The worse scenery
and highr expense is a davastating damage to both sides in tourism.

Help is needed to change this terrible and harse condition.  First of all,
a relative system of policy should be made to guide and regulate visitors&#39;
behavior. Misbehaved travellers should be fined to receive their lessons.
moreover, government should put more emphasis on school education on this
topic. Still, volunteers should be organized to guide visitors to behave
good and do as the roman&#39;s do.  Last but not the least, mind our own
behavior. Only when ourselves do a good thing and help this issue, then we
can solve this problem.</code></pre>

<pre class="tzx-bigquote"><code>As is shown on the drawing, undergraduates have four main roads to choose
from on the journey of life. Some of them are inclined to find a job and
work, while some others choose to work for themselves or even creating jobs
and hiring others.  Besides them, a large percent of them takes the exam to
graduate schools or even go abroad to further their study.

Most undergraduates are confused at these choices and wonder what&#39;s right
thing to do.  Under pressure of living independen*t*ly and potential
marriages, they feel at lost and not a small number of them choose to
follow the others. The situation should be changed. First, college should
guide undergraduates to be preparedd to live in society and plunge into
workforce.  Moreover, they themselves should look inside to their heart
asking what they themselves care capable of and suitable to do. Only
through this way can rational choices be made. Last but not the least,
government should make proper adequate polices to offer better more
opportunities.  Hope every undergraduate follow their heart, choose the
right way and have a bright future.</code></pre>

<p>Write a letter of about 100 words to the president of your university, suggesting how to improve students&#8217; physical condition.</p>
<pre class="tzx-bigquote"><code>Dear President,

Due to improvements in science and technology, most students live a
sedentary life nowadays which means they stay indoor often and seldom go
out for any physical activity or sports.  This physical inactivity make
them at a low lewel of physical condition making them suffer a lot from
colds, digestion disorder, weight gain or loss, bad sleeping and so on. I&#39;m
writing to inform you some suggestions on how to solve this problem.

First, more interesting and physically active games should be held to
attract students to take part in. In an atmosphere of joyfulness, their
physical condition improves. Secondly, physical activeness should
contribute to the GPA, which most students think really matters.  This will
caught broad attention and make decent progress.  Last, we should invite
more relative professors to deliver speeches on topics about pros of
physical activity and cons of sedentary living style which would make
studens be aware of their concerning physical condition and the urgentness
to a change in style of living.

I hope a careful consideration about the above suggestions and effective
actions to make a change to students&#39; physical condition.

<pre class="tzx-bigquote"><code>On the left of the drawing, the mother takes hand of the little girl, which
reveals the situation 30 years ago, while now the girl grown to be a lady
grabs hand of the old woman, the above-mentioned mother.

This drawing reflects love and devotion between parents and children. When
we are young, our parents provided us with sheltering, food and love, so we
can grow up and live independently. Then they are old, we in return take
care of and make our devotion to them just like they did years before.
This cycle reveals the meaning of families. Love and devotion in families
have meanings you may not know. First, they are symbols of family harmoney
and contribute to the general harmoney (harmony) and contribute to the
general harmoney of the society and our country. Moreover, they are key
factors to the survival of human being. We human survive the history not
because we are smart or strong to be capable in the competition with other
people and other living things, but because we cooperate, help and take
care of each other, especially in a family.  Last but not least, with
guarantee of protection from next generation, we can settle down and devote
ourselves to contributions to the society making our nation prosperate.

Above all, that&#39;s the meaning of families --- love and devotion.</code></pre>

<pre class="tzx-bigquote"><code>As is described on the drawing, there are two definitely different points
of views on the same bottle of spilt milk. The passive man on the left
thinks it all over while the man on the right positively looks at the
bright side saying that there are still half bottle of milk left.

This reflects two distinct attitudes towards life: being optimistic or
being pessimistic.  On one hand, a optimisticc man focuses on the positive
side of things who tends to live a happier life with joy, while passmistic
people feel awkward with multitudes of things. However, in the same time,
the former are inclined to get used to everything such that they are not
fully commited to change, while the later scratches their own itchy a lot
and comes up with new ideas and improvements to things one after another.
That&#39;s to say, we shall combine the former and the later that we can live
happily with a good temper cultivated with an optimistic view to life and
think critically witha passimistic attitude towards work to make progress.
Through the discussion above, we will not act like any one of them as
described in the drawing.  Instead, we shall be grateful to the little
drops left for us and without forgetting to try to figure out a way to
avoid such tragedy in the future.</code></pre>
